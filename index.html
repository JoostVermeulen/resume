					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<!-- about you -->
                    <p>Joost is specialized in performing technical – and analytical task within ICT projects.
                        The most remarkable features of his personality are his positive attitude and his communication skills.
                        The urge to expand his boundaries and always to learn and to specialize are making him a great asset to any project with challenging targets.
                        Although he is a real team player, independent and autonomous work is something he is not going out of the way. In problem situations, he will propagate himself as the driven problem solver. Joost will always strive for the best solution.
                        The various projects that Joost brought to a successful end for KBC Asset Management, KBC Bank, Fortis Bank underline his intelligence, stress resistance, creativity, and multi-purpose. 
                        Joost has experience in all phases of the software development life cycle (business analysis, functional and technical design, development, system testing, architecture, configuration management, release management) but most passionate in a technical role (technical architect/solution architect/technical lead)

                        Project ‘Client Reporting Project’.
Target: development of a ‘state-of-the-art’ reporting to the clients of Asset Management.
Joost took analysis, development, and implementation of the Document Engine Tool (DET) on his behalf.  This application is used for bulk and ad hoc creation of complex reports for the investment’s portfolios. The Det –Tool combines different reports (Business Objects) and office documents to a brochure. These brochures are sent automatically to the client. Given the confidential matter, these reports are critical for KBC AM.
The original application was developed in VB6 with an Oracle database. In this project Joost developed a specific knowledge of the communication between Business objects ad VB6.
Afterwards Joost rewrote the application from VB6 to .NET.
